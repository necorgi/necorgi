### About me

I am the owner of a company specializing in commercial software development. Together with my team of developers, we create diverse software—from websites and Telegram bots to full-fledged applications across various platforms. My preferred programming languages include Python, Swift, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, JS, and Java.

Outside of work, I am passionate about my hobby—corgis. I run the [t.me/necorgi](https://t.me/necorgi) channel, where daily corgi photos are posted. To streamline this process, I developed logic and am currently enhancing Telegram functionality. I plan to launch a channel for Samoyed enthusiasts at [t.me/nesamoyed](https://t.me/nesamoyed).

My journey began with studying Jailbreak and developing cheats for iOS games using ObjectiveC++ and theos (see my profile on [GitHub](https://github.com/)). I also explored UnityFramework and worked on hacking Unity games, expanding my knowledge and skills. Currently, I am actively learning to develop tweaks for iOS and Swift apps, while also experimenting with Python and other languages.

I prefer collaborating with friends and acquaintances, but I am always open to new connections and projects.
